# HR-Analytics-BI-Dashboard
Demonstration Simple Attrition Model :)
The Attrition Model I developed in Power BI covers multiple regions within a single dashboard, 
providing a dynamic overview of workforce movement. 
It uses various relationships between tables and applies DAX formulas to calculate headcounts based on a cutoff date accurately.
A calendar table is also integrated to allow for a detailed analysis of attrition trends over time. 
This model serves as an ideal starting point for any HR analytics team, 
enabling them to monitor and understand workforce dynamics more effectively. 
Please note that the employee names included in this model are solely for demonstration purposes and do not represent actual employees.
